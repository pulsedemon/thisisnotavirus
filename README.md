## What is this?

This is my personal site that I use to post JavaScript/CSS animations that I work on when I'm bored. I do this for fun, so don't expect this code to be totally production level. That said, it will run fine in any modern browser and load relatively quickly.

## Installation

Clone repo, then:

```
yarn install
yarn start
```

Should be accessible at http://localhost:3000 unless you've already occupied port 3000. See terminal output.
